#### Lost in antartic
The most inhospitable place on Earth is an engrossing setting for any story, be it fictional or factual. Unsurprisingly, Antarctica’s literary canon is filled with tales of tragedy and/or survival against the odds. It would be easy, then, to fill this list with biographies of Amundsen, Scott and Shackleton alone. But Antarctica deserves attention beyond its tales of tragedy.

With that in mind, we have taken a broader view. There are, of course, profiles of the pioneers and their epic journeys of discovery spanning more than a century of polar exploration, but we’ve also included a diverse mix of memoirs, biographies and novels – from crime to science fiction – all with Antarctica at the core of the narrative.

#### Endurance
In August 1914, polar explorer Ernest Shackleton boarded the Endurance and set sail for Antarctica where he planned to make the first crossing of the uncharted continent on foot. What unfolded would become the defining saga of the ‘Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration’. Lansing’s 1959 book (since republished) narrates the harrowing and miraculous voyage of Shackleton and his team as they battle the elements in one of the most astonishing feats of human courage.

#### The last place on Earth
In the finest analysis of Amundsen and Scott’s infamous race to the South Pole, Huntford captures the driving ambitions of the era and the complex and often deeply flawed men who were charged with carrying them out. It is also the only English-language work on the subject based on the original Norwegian sources
